I recently came across chatengine.io and took the time to read about it. After some consideration I actually decided to develop this project with some customizations. This application utilizes the chatengine.io APIs for user authentication and React.js for the frontend. Please feel free to clone it if you're interested.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
